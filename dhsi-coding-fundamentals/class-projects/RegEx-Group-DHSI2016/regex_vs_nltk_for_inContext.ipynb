    "You want to do this with regex so let's start with doing that for one case so that you can see the steps.  I'll just drop some text from the novel in here to work with while you'll load it from a set of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression that I'm using is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (?:^|\\W)([Ss]?[Hh]e(\\s|\\b)(?:.+?(?:\\b|\\s)){0,10})\n",
    "    \n",
    "I built it using https://regex101.com/ (regexpal.com isn't cutting it any more and this site provides explanations *for what you type* (try it).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the regex:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `(?:^|\\W)`:  This says that the string needs to either be at the start of the line *or* have a non-word character before it.  This prevents words with she/he from being inside them from being collected while still allowing she/he instances at the start of strings to be grabbed.  The `( )` make a group.  The `?:` stops the group from being a capturing group (we don't care about collecting these initial characters/makers). `^` is the code for the start of a string. `|` means \"or\". `\\W` means anything that isn't a word character (equivalent to `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]`).\n",
    "2. `([Ss]?[Hh]e\\s(?:.+?\\s){5})`:  The outer parentheses make this a capturing group, which is good, because this is what you want to grab.  I'll break each part down for you.\n",
    "3. `[Ss]?[Hh]e`: This will grab *either but not both* of a \"S\" or an \"s\" followed by *either or both* of a \"H\" or \"h\" followed by an \"e\" *OR* just ignore the s component (the `?` after the `[Ss]` means \"zero or one instance of the previous\").  This sets it up to grab the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * She\n",
    "    * she\n",
    "    * He\n",
    "    * he\n",
    "    * SHe\n",
    "    Want more?  Well now you have something to work with. =)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `(\\s|\\b)`: This says that the next component must be either a space or a word boundary.\n",
    "5. `(?:.+?(?:\\b|\\s)){0,10}`:  Again you see non-capturing groups here `(?:       )`, the outer most of and in this case it is repeated zero to five times via `{0,10}`.  `.+?` means to take any characters any number of times until the thing immediately after is found.  In this case it will collect characters until either a word boundary *or* a space is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this still doesn't grab everything you want.  For example.  \"He said 'She is awful.' She said 'He's a jerk.'\" will grab:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * He said 'She is awful.' She\n",
    "    * He's a jerk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, it does a pretty decent job.  So, let's see how to use it..."
