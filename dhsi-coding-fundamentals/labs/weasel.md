# Weasel Words Shell Experiment

Brian Garner, of Garner's Modern American Usage, defines a Weasel Word as:

> Equivocal or ambiguous word that diminishes the force of or meaning of a
concept being expressed; esp., an intensive such as *clearly* or *obviously*,
which while intended to strengthen th argument, actually has the effect of
weakening it by making its content more questionable.

Our experiment for today is to find the weasel words in a sample of our own
writing.

## Experiment

Using command line tools where possible perform the following actions.

- Create a project directory
- Find one of your papers
- Convert to txt
- Make everything lower case and remove punctuation
- Make a bag of words (tokenize)
- Count frequency and sort by number
- View the file, do you see any patterns?

## Challenge! 

- Remove common english stopwords before counting frequency
- hint use `grep -vwFf stop-words.txt`
