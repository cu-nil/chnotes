> When doing research, and especially as part of a team, best practice is always to ensure that
there is clarity of roles at the beginning and throughout a research project. This will help to
speed things up and avoid confusion and potential disputes at the time of reporting and writing
work up, and when individuals may need to describe their contributions according to the CRediT
taxonomy.[^5]

CUNIL follows the guidelines set by [Contributor Role Taxonomy][001] (CRediT) developed by
National Information Standards Organization (NISO).

- As a rule of thumb, our first authors should take ownership especially at research stages
of conceptualization, writing, and project administration --- ensuring timely progress to
submission.
- Discuss roles and attribution early. Update throughout.
- Facilitate clear ownership of specific tasks.
- The sequence of authors should be determined by their relative contribution to the
project.
- The last author will often act in the supervisory role, anchoring the project in favor of
junior colleagues.
- The lab's GitHub project template includes a CREDIT file that should be updated regularly.
- Keep a log of your work. Channel your contributions through GitHub and Google Docs as much as
possible, where the logging happens automatically.
- Late projects may be reassigned, under consultation between faculty advisors.
- An internal review should generally precede journal or conference submission.
- Be open and forthright about your expectations. Do not hesitate to bring up any issues that
may arise with the lab's faculty advisors.

## CRedIT

> CRediT is a high-level taxonomy, including 14 roles, that can be used to represent the roles
typically played by contributors to scientific scholarly output. The roles describe each
contributor’s specific contribution to the scholarly output.[^5]

The [Training Data Lab][002] at Leiden University, Netherlands provides a concise graphical
representation of the labels as follows:
