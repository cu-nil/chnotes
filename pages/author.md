CUNIL follows the guidelines set by [Contributor Role Taxonomy][001] (CRediT) developed by
National Information Standards Organization (NISO).

> CRediT is a high-level taxonomy, including 14 roles, that can be used to represent the roles
typically played by contributors to scientific scholarly output. The roles describe each
contributor’s specific contribution to the scholarly output.[^1]

The [Training Data Lab][002] at Leiden University, Netherlands provides a concise graphical
representation of the labels as follows:
